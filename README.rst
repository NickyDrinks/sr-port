Second Reality Effects
======================

A few effects from Second Reality ported to Linux.


Notes
-----

* OpenGL is used for 2D presentation only, all 3D transformations are
  computed using demo code.

* Original file layout used when possible.

* Ported code should be resolution-independent.

* IDEA: original bitmap art can be upscaled with 4xbrz.

* IDEA: make ported DIS code interface to libxmp to get music information.

Work in progress. I thought the polyhedron was an icosahedron, but it is
in fact a `tetrakis hexahedron`_.
