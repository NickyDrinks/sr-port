Second Reality Effects
======================

A few effects from Second Reality ported to Linux.


Notes
-----

* OpenGL is used for 2D presentation only, all 3D transformations are
  computed using demo code.

* Original file layout used when possible.

* Ported code should be resolution-independent and framerate-independent.

* Pixel art upscaled with 4xbrz.

* IDEA: make ported DIS code interface to libxmp to get music information.
